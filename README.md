# WebRTC Demo with ASP.NET Core
This is a demo of using WebRTC with ASP.NET Core as a signaling server.
WebRTC allows direct peer-to-peer communication to work inside web pages.
This demo shows audio/video communication and file sharing without sending data through the server.

## Demo
Since some browsers don't support WebRTC, I recommend using Google Chrome.
